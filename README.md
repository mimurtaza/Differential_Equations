Differential_Equations
======================

Implementing numerical methods for differential equations using Python. Using IPython Notebook for the purpose of notes and implementation. The numerical methods are based on Kreyszig's textbook, "Advanced Engineering Mathematics", 9ed, Wiley International.

This project contains IPython Notebooks on the following topics:

- First Order Ordinary Differential Equation - Euler method, Improved Euler method, Runge Kutta 4th Order method
- System of First Order ODEs or Higher Order ODEs - Euler method, Runge-Kutta method
- Examples
-   Airy Equation (Second order ODE)
-   Blasius' Equation (Third order ODE)
- More to come...
